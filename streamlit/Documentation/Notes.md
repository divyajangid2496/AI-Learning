# Context in Conversational AI Applications

Refer: [OpenAI ChatBot](../OpenAIChatBot.py)

In conversational AI applications, providing context by sending all previous messages to the chat completion endpoint is a common practice. This approach aims to enhance the quality of responses generated by the AI model and create more engaging interactions with users. Here's how it works:

## Why Send All Previous Messages?

- Sending all previous messages to the chat completion endpoint helps provide context for the AI model to generate coherent and relevant responses.
- The context from previous messages helps the AI model understand the conversation flow, maintain continuity, and infer user intent effectively.

## How It Works

1. **Storing Messages**: Each message exchanged in the conversation is stored in memory, typically in a structured format with details like role and content.
2. **Sending Messages to Chat Completions Endpoint**: When triggering the chat completions endpoint, all previous messages along with the current message are sent as input to the AI model.
3. **Generating Responses**: The AI model uses the context from previous messages to generate responses that are aligned with the conversation history.
4. **Improving User Experience**: By leveraging context, the AI model can provide more personalized and engaging responses, leading to a better user experience.

## Application in ChatGPT

- When interacting with ChatGPT on its website or platform, a similar approach is used to provide context by sending all previous messages.
- This context helps ChatGPT understand the conversation flow, maintain coherence, and generate more relevant responses based on the ongoing dialogue.

In summary, sending all previous messages to the chat completion endpoint is essential for context-rich conversations in AI applications, enabling the AI model to provide more personalized and engaging responses to users.
